# Analogue-Clock
Analogue Clock Project Using Html/Css and JavaScript

Well, well, well, look who's got a fancy new clock on their website! You know what they say, time flies when you're having fun, but with this clock, time will practically do a triple backflip and land right on your screen. It's so accurate, it could probably time a hummingbird's heartbeats. And if you're ever feeling like time is dragging on, just stare at this clock for a few seconds and watch time fly by at lightning speed! But be warned, you might get so caught up in staring at the clock that you forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place. Don't say I didn't warn you!

Enjoy!!!
